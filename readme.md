# Practice with Mongoid Relationships

In this lab, you'll get practice building out relationships with multiple Mongoid-backed models. Our objects are as follows:

## Objectives:

- Practice writing the code necessary to **connect two models** in a relationship

- Practice **updating our controller** to allow saving that relationship

- Practice **changing our forms** to be able to give a user the ability to save those relationships

In the meantime, you'll get practice building out CRUD functionality for each model, which will make you faster & more ready to build even more advanced applications.

## The App

The idea for the app you're about to build is a bookshelf of sorts. There's a ``User`` object already created for you, as well as a full CRUD controller & accompanying views.

**Your goal is to create an application that lets people store _something_ on their bookshelf.** You get to pick what sort of collection of things you want a user to store:

- a user's fancy Scotch collection
- a user's clothing or shoe collection
- a user's book or DVD collection

You're welcome to make any type of collection you like! Don't spend too long deciding, you'll have to build the relationships. 

You'll have to make the **model**, the **controller**, and the **views**. And don't forget to set up your **routes**!
